# Stream (流)

1. What is streaming data?

   Streaming data is continuously generated data. Such flow of data can be called a data stream.

1. What is stream processing?

1. What is unbounded and bounded data stream (有界和无界数据流)?

   Unbounded streams have a start but no defined end. Bounded streams have a defined start and end.

1. Can unbounded data stream be feed not in the original order?

   It is possible to process data stream not in the original order. For example, calculating the sum may not require the data stream to be ingested in the original order. However, it is generally required that events are ingested in a specific order.

1. What are real-time and recorded data streams (实时和历史纪录数据流)?

   It is possible to record a stream and process it later rather than real-time processing.
