# Redis

(From https://try.redis.io/)

> Redis is in the family of databases called key-value stores.
>
> The essence of a key-value store is the ability to store some data, called a value, inside a key. This data can later be retrieved only if we know the exact key used to store it.
> 
> Often Redis it is called a data structure server because it has outer key-value shell, but each value can contain a complex data structure, such as a string, a list, a hashes, or ordered data structures called sorted sets as well as probabilistic data structures like hyperloglog.
