# Array (数组)

1. What is an array?

   An array is a collection of items indexed by integers.

   We don't care about other restrictions (e.g. fixed length, items of the same type) here unless otherwise specified.

1. What techniques can be used to solve array problems?

   1. Binary search (二分搜索, when the array is sorted)
   1. Two pointers (双指针, when the array is sorted)
   1. Dynamic programming (动态规划, when sub-problem spaces overlap)

## Problems

| # | Title | Difficulty | Technique(s) | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 977 | Squares of a Sorted Array | Easy | Two pointers | Sorted |
